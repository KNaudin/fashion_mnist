# Fashion MNIST
Simple deep learning using the keras fashion_mnist  dataset

## Requirements for the project
- Python 3.5
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Tensorflow (gpu is recommanded for optimal computation time)

> This project is using PyCharm as its IDE, hence the multiple files included alongside the main fashion_mnist.py file
For more information on this type of network, please visit [the keras documentation](https://keras.io)
